# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## **Project Description**
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It tracks key metrics such as cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The project provides insightful visualizations and analysis, enabling users to understand the pandemic's progression and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns worldwide.

## **Objectives of the Project**
- **Data Collection**: Import and clean COVID-19 global data from reliable sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- **Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations to compare COVID-19 trends across different countries and regions.
- **Insights**: Communicate key findings with a clear narrative and visualizations.
- **Choropleth Map (Optional)**: Visualize COVID-19 data on a world map to identify regional trends.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Built on top of matplotlib, used for statistical data visualization.
- **plotly** (Optional): Used for creating interactive visualizations, especially the choropleth map.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment used to create and run the code in an interactive manner.

## **How to Run/View the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-data-tracker.git

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure to install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Navigate to the folder where the notebook is located, and start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

   Open the `covid19_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook and run each cell to see the analysis and visualizations.

4. **(Optional) Export to PDF**:
   If you'd like to share or present the notebook as a PDF, go to **File** -> **Download as** -> **PDF**.

## **Insights and Reflections**

* The analysis highlights the **impact of vaccination rollouts** on reducing cases and deaths, especially in countries with faster vaccine distribution.
* **Country-specific trends** show the differing challenges faced by nations, such as delays in vaccine distribution and spikes in cases due to new variants.
* **Death rate analysis** indicates that healthcare infrastructure and early interventions played a critical role in reducing fatalities in some countries.

Overall, this project emphasizes the importance of timely interventions, the need for efficient vaccine rollouts, and the role of data-driven insights in managing global health crises.
